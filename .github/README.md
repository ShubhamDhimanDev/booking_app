MeetFlow is a powerful, scalable booking management system built with Laravel that enables professionals, consultants, coaches, and businesses to manage their appointments seamlessly. With Google Calendar integration, multi-gateway payment processing, and an intelligent refund system, MeetFlow simplifies the entire appointment lifecycle.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**The Challenge:** Service providers struggle with fragmented booking tools that don't integrate with their existing workflows. Manual calendar management leads to double bookings, payment collection is scattered across multiple platforms, and refund handling is time-consuming and error-prone.

**The Solution:** MeetFlow consolidates booking management, calendar synchronization, payment processing, and automated communications into a single, cohesive platform. Organizers can focus on delivering value while MeetFlow handles the operational complexity.

## 📦 Installation

### **Prerequisites**
- PHP 8.0 or higher
- Composer 2.x
- Node.js 16+ and NPM
- MySQL 5.7+ or PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud Project (for Calendar API)
- Razorpay/PayU account (for payments)

### **Setup Steps**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd meetflow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. **Set up database**
   ```bash
   # Configure DB_* variables in .env
   php artisan migrate
   ```

5. **Configure services in `.env`**
   ```env
   # Google Calendar
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/google/callback
   
   # Payment Gateways (or configure via admin panel)
   RAZORPAY_KEY=your_razorpay_key
   RAZORPAY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret
   
   # Queue Configuration
   QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
   ```

6. **Build frontend assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Or for development
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   # Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

8. **Run queue worker** (in separate terminal)
   ```bash
   php artisan queue:work
   ```

### **Important Notes**
- Google OAuth only works with `127.0.0.1`, not `.test` domains in local development
- Configure payment gateway credentials via Admin Panel → Payment Gateway Settings
- Set up cron job for scheduled tasks: `* * * * * php artisan schedule:run`
- **Google Token Management:** Tokens automatically refresh - see [docs/GOOGLE_TOKEN_MANAGEMENT.md](../docs/GOOGLE_TOKEN_MANAGEMENT.md) for details

### **Google OAuth Token Management**

MeetFlow implements automatic Google OAuth token refresh to prevent re-authentication:

```bash
# Check token status for all users
php artisan google:refresh-tokens --check

# Manually refresh expired tokens
php artisan google:refresh-tokens

# Schedule automatic daily refresh (recommended)
# Add to app/Console/Kernel.php schedule method
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Automatic token refresh before expiration (5-minute buffer)
- ✅ Middleware-level token validation and refresh
- ✅ Centralized GoogleCalendarService for all API operations
- ✅ Persistent refresh tokens (no re-auth needed)
- ✅ Graceful error handling and logging

**For detailed documentation, troubleshooting, and Google verification checklist, see:**
📖 [Google Token Management Guide](../docs/GOOGLE_TOKEN_MANAGEMENT.md)
